Your World: A Settled Life on Parnassus
You’re a freighter captain, and a good one, with a long career of navigating the hazards of the Orion Fringe. But you’ve traded the unpredictable void for a quiet life with your wife, Elara, on your homeworld of Parnassus. The planet is renowned for its stunning mountain ranges, and your shared passion has always been hiking its high, winding trails. Now, with your ship, the Vagrant, mostly docked, you're ready to settle down for good.

That future has been thrown into uncertainty. A mysterious neuro-muscular ailment has begun to affect Elara, slowly stealing her ability to walk. The local doctors on Parnassus are stumped. The only name in the galaxy synonymous with cutting-edge medical care is Xenocorp Dynamics. You know they can likely fix her legs, but you also know the cost will be astronomical. Hoping for a better deal, you reach out to your cousin, Leo, a researcher at their flagship facility in the Sol-Core Sector. He tells you to come in for a consultation.

Once you arrive, he pulls you aside. He confirms your fears about the crippling debt the official procedure would cause, but he offers another way. He can fix your wife, but he needs a favor first. He needs a skilled pilot to retrieve a data core from a desolate, abandoned planet called Aetia-7, deep in the haunted Echo Sector. He’s vague about the details, but you don’t press him. You've done jobs with less information in your past, and if it means Elara can walk the high trails again, so be it.

The Mission: Ghosts of the Past
The journey to the Echo Sector is eerie, a flight through a graveyard of silent, ancient warships. You find Aetia-7 at the coordinates Leo provided. The planet is desolate, bearing the scars of what looks like an orbital bombardment. Buried under the ruins is a bunker. As you work your way inside, you notice markings on the decaying infrastructure. It’s the insignia of a small logistics company you recognize from your early days—a subcontractor that Xenocorp used heavily while they were still in their infancy, before they became a galactic powerhouse. It seems they were wiped out.

You find the data core. It’s a stunning piece of technology, self-powered and encased in a shielded, cryo-stabilized housing. You know immediately that this is incredibly valuable; you could sell this core on the black market for a fortune. You secure the prize and head back to the Vagrant.

On your way out of the atmosphere, you get ambushed. An old, heavily armed security ship powers up from a hidden position and opens fire. Your mind makes the connection instantly: you are in way over your head. The information on this core is something Xenocorp is willing to kill for, even decades later. Your priority shifts. The last thing you can afford is to become a wanted Xenocorp fugitive while Elara is waiting for her procedure. You have to eliminate the threat, and any record of you being here. A tense dogfight ensues. You manage to destroy the ship, but not before it lands a few solid hits on the Vagrant.

The Revelation at Lightspeed
You successfully initiate the FTL jump and escape the Echo Sector. On the long way back home, with the immediate danger gone, you access the data from the core. The truth is horrifying, but it all makes sense. Xenocorp bioengineers these diseases. They release them into the wild on developing worlds to entice the desperate into their expensive medical treatments. The subcontractors on Aetia-7 were likely the original researchers, silenced and erased once their work was done.

There's more on the drive—financial records, target lists—but you are interrupted by a series of critical alarms. Your FTL drive malfunctions catastrophically. The damage from the security ship was worse than you thought. It’s clear now that the old drone was programmed with one simple directive: do not let this data escape. It nearly succeeded. You are forced to make an emergency crash landing on the nearest habitable planet.

The Wager on a Twilight World
You awaken on the dangerous planet Ja'kar. This world is back in your home sector, the Orion Fringe, but it's a far cry from the peace of Parnassus. It is a tidally locked planet, and all life clings to the "Twilight Belt" between a scorched wasteland and a frozen expanse. The main city, Terminus, is a lawless hive of scavengers and syndicates. You are out of your element, and you learn quickly that there is no place for you here. The repairs to your ship are not cheap; the drone fried a key component of your FTL drive—a Manifold Synchronization Coil.

In this sector, you hear whispers of an illicit, high-stakes card game called Stargaze, a way for the desperate to win big or lose everything. Your search for parts eventually leads you to The Crimson Comet, a cantina run by a hulking proprietor named Grokk. One night, after weeks of dead ends, Grokk confronts you. His salvager crews had picked your crash site clean and found a fragment of the data core's unique housing, marked with an old Xenocorp R&D serial number. He knows you're protecting something valuable.

He has the Manifold Coil you need, but he proposes a wager. He leads you to a private table where a holographic starfield swirls. He will stake the parts to fix your ship. In return, you must wager the data core. He doesn’t know its contents, only that you were nearly killed for it. And on this dangerous twilight world, that makes it the ultimate prize.
