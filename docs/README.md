# Stargaze Deckbuilder: Project Documentation Index

Welcome to the Stargaze Deckbuilder documentation! This folder contains all high-level design, architecture, and gameplay documentation for the project.

## Index

- `gameplay-loop.md` — Core gameplay loop architecture, state machine, and flow.
- `sectors.md` — Sector and scenario design notes.
- `setting6.md` — Setting and narrative background.
- (Add new docs here as the project evolves)

## How to Use
- All new features, mechanics, or design changes should be documented here before or alongside implementation.
- Use this folder for "why" and high-level design; use JSDoc in code for "how".
- Keep this index up to date as new docs are added.
